# LaTeX-Curriculum-Vitae

This CV template is inspired by these works:
- https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume
- https://github.com/jberger/Curriculum_Vita

I provide this repository with a customised list of publications bibliography `*.bst` from [jberger](https://github.com/jberger/Curriculum_Vita), it can show publications by year with reverse order (latest in the top). Mainly, this CV is modified from [Deedy-Resume](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume). He started with a one-page and two asymmetric column resume, but I changed it into a one column and two pages curriculum vitae. I also edited almost all of the style in each command.

If you plan to use this template, perhaps this will not go smooth as you expected. Ask me if you need my help.

I developed this by using TexPad macOS, hopefully it will work for your LaTeX environment too.
